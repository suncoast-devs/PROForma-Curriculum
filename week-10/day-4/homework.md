# I Complete my Subscribe to Your Theory!

For this weekend, you will be completing the subscription service site. This site will allow a user to purchase a subscription to a subscription box, like this site: https://hackerboxes.com/. 

We will be working on this site in a "glass down" manner. starting with the HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This site will be used by the company to allow users to subscribe to the a box.

This site will be used by a company to allow employees of the site to manage subscriptions

You should have the app completed for Monday. 

## Site Requirements 

-Allow guest to subscribe to boxes:
    - the site should display all the boxes availible to subscribe to. Each box should have its own page showing the details and example boxes.
    - As a guest I can sign up for box. This should take me a new page that allows me to subscribe to the box. When a user signs up for a box, they get a confirmation number. This does not mean that users will have an account. 
    - When a guest signs up for a box, they enter their name, phone, email, address. All the fields are required. 
- Allow employees to see and manage subscriptions and products. These should be authenticated users, the traditional sense. They should be able to sign up, and log in (can be the same or different pages)
- This should be 2 pages, one for managing subscriptions, and one for managing products
