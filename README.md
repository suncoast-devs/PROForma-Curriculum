This repository contains the Cirriculum for the PROforma Cohort used by [The Suncoast Developers Guild](http://suncoast.io).


## How this repo is broken down
 
 This curriculum is broken down by week, then by day. Each day has at least 4 .md files, lecture_notes, activity, warm_up, homework. The lecture_notes contain the topics for the instructor to cover that day. The activity includes the daily, non-graded activity. The activity could be more lecture, pair programing, solo programing or group work. The warm_up is a small challenge (kata style) that allows the students to get their brains working first thing in the morning. The homework is the daily homework that is assigned at lunch time and due at midnight.
