# Catch your Breathe

We have been going a fast pace for the past couple of week. Every so often, you need to reflect on how far you have come.
 
For tonight, we are going to take a little code break and create a blog post. Blog posts are a good way to reflect on what you have done and also share some knowledge. The best way to get better at talking about technology is practice. Blog posts are a way to practice that skill. 

## Objectives

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] On medium.com(https://medium.com/), create a blog post that talks about a concept we have went over in class. This could anything  topic from HTML, CSS or JavaScript. Or it could be a lesson that learn from the past couple of weeks. All I am looking for a developer focused blog post. 
- [ ] to turn this in, submit to me, via the github issue, the link to the blog post

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] As we progress, we will be using different tools to work our brain. Today, head over to hackerrank.com (https://www.hackerrank.com/). This is another tool, like codewars to practice our developer skills. As a start, head into the algorithms section, and try this one: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/grading/problem. 
- [ ] To turn this, create a gist (gist.github.com) of your code and put it on this issue

### Epic Mode

- [ ] Go back and finish up any oustanding work. 
- [ ] Go back to an old assignment and work on it some more. This could trying to tackle a harder level. Or going back and working on the UI/UX of an assignment, refactor the code to a new idea that we covered (EX: functions and abstractions) or adding unit tests to a something 
- [ ] to turn this, put the github repo here, and tell me about what you did.
