# Google it

Take time this morning to replicate https://www.google.com/ the best you can 

Start with a mock up on paper and figure out what HTML elements you need. 
Then create the HTML, then worry about the styling. 

Challenge yourself to see how far you can get.

NOTE: There are 3 new html tags present, a form tag, an input tag, and a button tag. Don't be afraid of things you don't know, use this as a practice to finding how to use unknown tags. 

PROTIP: Worry about the new last, and get the layout working

CURIOUS? : do a 'right click inspect element' on the website too see how they do it. There is a lot going on there, but i challenge you to look and try to figure out what they did
