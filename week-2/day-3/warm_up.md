## Explorer
Create a simple website that allows the user to click a button and it changes the body's background color to a random color. Display the new color on the screen in a `h1` tag


## Adventure
Make it so that, instead of the body's color, it changes a section on the page to a random color

## Epic: 
Make it so that when clicked, it generates 5 random colors, and displays all five. in a similar manner as https://coolors.co/
