These steps will be followed for almost every assignment going forward. Once you've completed at least _explorer_ mode and you're satisfied with your work, let's get it published. First let's get it up on GitHub.

- First, let's add all our work to git, and ask it to commit it:

  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "My first webpage"
  ```

  Feel free to replace _"My first webpage"_ with a more meaningful message.

- Push our local commits to GitHub:

  ```sh
  git push -u origin master
  ```

  The `-u` option tells git we want to making pushing the `master` branch to `origin` the default, so next time, we can just type `git push`.

- Now that our source code is up on GitHub, let's publish our page to [Surge](https://surge.sh). The command to do this has already been setup for you:

  ```sh
  yarn deploy
  ```

Once you are completely, go to the issue on our `assignments` repository, leave the link the repo of your work, and close the issue. I will not know you are down until you close the issue.
