# Hello, World!

As a developer, learning is a life long skill that you wil continue to hone. During the last 9 weeks, you have learned many topics, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. For this project I want you to select a topic in technology and give a short presentation about it. 


## Explorer Mode

- [ ] Select a topic, get it approved by your instructor,  and research the topic to understand it
- [ ] Give a 5-10 minutes presentation about that piece of technology that includes: 
    - What is the technology
    - What problem does the technology Solved
    - Why makes the technology unique
- [ ] Include a Hello World Implementation of the app. 
- [ ] Be able to answer some questions about from the group 


*DELIVERABLES:*
- a "Hello World App" demonstrating the technology in a git repo

*NOTES*
- A power point is not needed. As long as you can demo the code and get across the idea of the technology
- 5 mins is not a long time when talking about technology. 

## Adventure
- Build a non-trivial App that uses your technology. For example, if you choose React, a simple Hello, World app displays the current time, but a non-trivial app can talk to the weather API and display the current weather

## Explorer. 
- Keep on Building more and more advance features
