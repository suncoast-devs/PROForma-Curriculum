# A Portfolio

For your first weekend project, we're going to be starting work on a portfolio website that you can improve over the rest of your career. 

![Mockup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiy-tpa-fee/assignments/master/portfolio/mockup.png)

You can find image assets you'll need here:

> https://github.com/tiy-tpa-fee/assignments/tree/master/portfolio/assets

The font used is [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).

## Objectives

- Build on your knowledge of HTML & CSS
- Implement, from scratch, a given design
- Use flexbox techniques layout pages.

## Requirements

- Initially, you should implement the design as close as possible to the mockup. Later, you might choose to fit your own personality/style.

- **Note**: You should complete at least the tasks given for _explorer_ mode as listed below before turning in the assignment, as well as before attempting _adventure_ or _epic_ modes.

### Explorer Mode

- [ ] Recreate the page as closely as you possibly can. Use the same fonts, sizes, and colors.

### Adventure Mode

- [ ] Take the time to personalize the site.
- [ ] Keep it professional, but make it your own.



## Turning In

Your homework will be assigned to you via `issues` on your `assignments` repository. Once you are

These steps will be followed for almost every assignment going forward. Once you've completed at least _explorer_ mode and you're satisfied with your work, let's get it published. First let's get it up on GitHub.

- First, let's add all our work to git, and ask it to commit it:

  ```sh
  git add .
  git commit -m "My first webpage"
  ```

  Feel free to replace _"My first webpage"_ with a more meaningful message.

- Push our local commits to GitHub:

  ```sh
  git push -u origin master
  ```

  The `-u` option tells git we want to making pushing the `master` branch to `origin` the default, so next time, we can just type `git push`.

- Now that our source code is up on GitHub, let's publish our page to [Surge](https://surge.sh). The command to do this has already been setup for you:

  ```sh
  yarn deploy
  ```

Once you are completely, go to the issue on our `assignments` repository, leave the link the repo of your work, and close the issue. I will not know you are down until you close the issue.
