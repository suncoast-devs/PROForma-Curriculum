[Learning Objectives] practice CSS
[Learning Objectives] Learn more about github


## Complete the sample site

Together in class we made a skeleton html of a site. Fork the repo on github and add the css to get as close as possible to the websites look. Focus on structure first, then work on style. Try to change as little as possible. 

## Goals

- Practice writing CSS against someone elses HTML
- when you are complete, submit a pull request back up the upstream
