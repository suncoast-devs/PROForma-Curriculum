# It was the developer, in the library, with angular

The library was super impress with your API, now they want you to create a Web UI for them, using your API. 

## Objectives
- Work on using AngularJS create a UI on top of an API

### Explorer Mode
- [ ] Add Angular to your project.
- [ ] Implement a UI that allows a user to use the endpoints that you created already. This should include
    - [ ] Seeing all books
    - [ ] Searching for a book to checkout
    - [ ] Checking out a book
    - [ ] Checking a book back in

*NOTES*
- Even though you are making a UI, do not get caught in how it looks, remember to make it functional, then make it working
- If you didn't complete the weekend assignment, work on creating the UI first for the endpoints you have, then work on extending your API
- A user only needs to supply an email to checkout a book, full blown authentication is not needed. 

### Adventure Mode 
*some are extended from the weekend project* 

- [ ] Using CSS, style your website to have a modern look
- [ ] Normalize your database to have `Genre` be its own table
- [ ] Create the endpoints that allows to Update Movies
- [ ] Extend your `Search` endpoint to have many 
 

### Epic Mode
* This will challenge your CSS and Design skills*
- [ ] Using `Bootstrap` create a solid UI with no Custom CSS
- [ ] Using `Material Design` as a guideline, learn about and implement a UI that follows the guidelines.
